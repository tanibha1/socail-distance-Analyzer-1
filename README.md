# Social Distancing Analyzer

## Overview

<b>Social distancing</b> is deliberately increasing the physical space between people to avoid spreading illness. Staying at least six feet away from other people lessens your chances of catching <b>COVID-19</b>. This project uses OpenCV and YOLO to monitor/analyze whether people are maintaining social distancing or not.

<ul>
  <li>This project uses YOLO for object detection.</li>
  <li>Once the objects(people) are detected it then draws a bounding box around them.</li>
  <li>Using the centroid of the boxes we then measure the distances between them.</li>
  <li>For the distance measure, <b>Euclidean Distance</b> was used.</li>
  <li>A box is colored RED if unsafe and GREEN if safe.</li>
</ul>

## Getting started

1. Clone and download the repo
```bash
  git clone <this_repo_url>
```

2. Then download the YOLOv3 weights from this <a href="https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights">link</a> and store it in the yolov3 folder as <b>yolov3.weights</b>

3. Download the required python packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the main.py file
```bash
python main.py
```

## Limitations and Future Scope

<ul>
  <li>This project does not take into account the camera perspective.</li>
  <li>It does not leverage a proper camera calibration (Distances are not measure accurate).</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;<b><i>Will work on these limitations.</i><b>
